## Managing Core as a Project Dependency
Sites managed with Composer should use the nested docroot feature, which allows core to be installed within the `web` subdirectory instead of the default root directory of the site's codebase. A nested docroot is the simplest path towards reliable core updates in a Composer workflow.

This is possible on Pantheon by specifying `web_docroot: true` in `pantheon.yml` file. For details, see [Serving Sites from the Web Subdirectory](/docs/nested-docroot/).

## Pull Request Workflow
In this workflow, a [Multidev](/docs/multidev/) environment is created on Pantheon for each pull request branch on GitHub. Work in these environments can also be committed back to the same branch for review on GitHub. When a pull request is merged into the default branch on GitHub, the result is deployed to the Dev environment on Pantheon:

### Scaling Considerations
We recommend the Pull Request workflow for single site use cases, and for most use cases involving larger site portfolios such as EDUs. You can create a "template" repository based off Pantheon's example repositories and customize it to your liking, then use the template to create new sites.

However, this method does not support One-click updates in the Site Dashboard. Adopting this workflow means forgoing all other update techniques in favor of Composer. If your use case requires a simpler update strategy for non-technical site admins, this workflow could present problems scaling or at the very least require additional training for your development team.


## Custom Upstream Workflow
It is possible to preserve the functionality of Pantheon's One-click updates in the Site Dashboard for Composer managed sites created from a [Custom Upstream](/docs/custom-upstream/), however its use case is quite narrow.

A Custom Upstream based off Pantheon's example repositories would need to commit all dependencies. Updates via Composer would only happen at the Custom Upstream repository level by a single repository maintainer. Those updates would then trickle down to sites created from the Custom Upstream as One-click updates in the Pantheon Site Dashboard.

This workflow has one very serious shortcoming, that is site-specific dependencies are likely to cause a lot of conflicts. The practical use case for this workflow is for a large group of sites that require a single set of dependencies. You should only use this method if you donâ€™t intend to use site specific themes, modules, or plugins downstream.

## Next Steps
Follow the [Build Tools Guide](/docs/guides/build-tools/) to learn best practices for Composer on Pantheon.

### Partial Adoption
If you're not ready to go all in with a Composer workflow and you want to see how it works on a smaller scale, follow the [Manage Some Dependencies with Composer](/docs/guides/partial-composer/) guide to get started.
